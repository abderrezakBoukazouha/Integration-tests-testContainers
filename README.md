# Test containers POC :

POC to display how to setup Test containers to launch integration tests with Java Spring Boot. 

The solution was to implement an abstract class to use it in multiple scenarios. 


To use it, you should verify that docker is running behind, and then at Root, use the command : `mvn clean install`
